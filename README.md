# CGPA Calculator Project (Group 9)

This project contains a simple C++ program to calculate the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) for a student based on their semester results.

## Files
- `semester.cpp`: Main C++ source file containing the logic to input semester grades, calculate the CGPA, and display the result.
- `cgpa_result.txt`: Output file where the calculated CGPA is saved after running the program.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## How to Use
1. Compile the C++ source file:
   ```bash
   g++ semester.cpp -o cgpa
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./cgpa
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to enter your semester grades.
4. The calculated CGPA will be displayed and saved to `cgpa_result.txt`.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Linux environment (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04)
- Optional: WSL with VS Code to have a Linux environment on Windows

## How to Install WSL (Ubuntu 24.04) on Windows
1. Press the Windows key + X
2. Open Terminal (Admin) or Command Prompt
3. Type:
   ```bash
   wsl --install
   ```
4. Wait for installation to complete
5. Download and install VS Code
6. Open VS Code and go to Extensions to download the WSL extension
7. Open a new window and connect to WSL by typing `>WSL` in the search bar
8. Click on "Connect to WSL"
9. Open the terminal in VS Code and install the Ubuntu distribution if prompted
